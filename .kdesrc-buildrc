# This is the directory that your KDE sources are downloaded to.  This
# directory also holds the build and log directories by default.
	source-dir /code/kde/src/KDE

# This is the directory that KDE will end up installed at.  The default is
# appropriate for a single-user installation of KDE, which requires no root
# permissions.  If you'd like, you can install and use the sudo program to
# install KDE anywhere on your system, in conjunction with the
# make-install-prefix option.
	kdedir /code/kde/inst/master
#	kdedir /opt/kde
#
# You can overwrite the installation directory for a given module using
# the per-module "prefix" option. Note that when doing this you need to
# set KDEDIRS, PATH and LD_LIBRARY_PATH to point to both directories,
# and that you should use separate test users or KDEHOME values to separate
# the ksycoca databases. Only set prefix if you know what you're doing.

# This is the Qt installation to use to build KDE.  The default is qt-copy
# from Subversion.  Qt will be installed to this directory, so it is
# recommended to use something like ~/qt-4.
# KDE /trunk requires a very recent Qt so qt-copy is the best route if you're
# building /trunk.  If you are building an older branch you may use your
# system installed Qt by setting qtdir to point to it (what qmake -v
# reports with the /lib removed).
	qtdir /code/kde/inst/master  # Default to installing Qt

# By default (if the above is commented out), you are getting trunk.
# If instead you want to check out another branch, like 4.4, use
#	branch 4.5
#
# but also see the qt-copy and kdesupport modules below, which have special
# requirements

# To use a single git repository to download multiple KDE source modules, you
# can define a "base repository", which you can use later with a "module-set"
# grouping and the "use-modules" option. This sets up the "kde-projects" git
# repository, you can change the URL if you are a developer.
#	git-repository-base kde-projects git://anongit.kde.org/
	git-repository-base kde-projects git@git.kde.org: # Developers

# This is the Subversion server to download the rest of the KDE sources from.  Developers:
# Don't forget to add your username to the URL if necessary!

# cmake-options controls the compilation options for building KDE 4 modules.
# These options apply to all KDE modules unless otherwise specified.
# NOTE: If you want the cxxflags option below to work (advanced users only)
# then make sure to set the "-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=none" here, or in the specific
# module's cmake-options
#
# Also see http://techbase.kde.org/Development/Tutorials/CMake#Command_Line_Variables

# These are the default options passed to the make command.  The default tries
# to build with 2 parallel compiles.  If you are using distcc or have SMP, you
# should experiment with setting this value higher for best performance.

# KDE has one of the most extensive translation packages in the world.  They
# are stored in the l10n module.  kdesrc-build can automatically try to build
# and install languages for you, using this parameter.  It should be a list
# of languages to build and install.  This option requires the language code
# as present in l10n.  You can look these codes up at

# If you would like install KDE to the system (DO NOT INSTALL *over* a prior
# installation!), then you'll probably need to use sudo to install everything.
#
# The -S parameter causes sudo to read from standard input (which is redirected
# by kdesrc-build).  This means that if sudo has to ask for your password, it
# will fail, you need to configure sudo to be able to run "make install"
# without requesting a password.
#
# In addition, you can run kdesrc-build --no-install, and then
# sudo kdesrc-build --install if you are unable to configure sudo to allow
# make install with no password.
#	 make-install-prefix sudo -S

# purge-old-logs controls whether old log files should be removed after the
# latest build finishes. Set to true to enable it.
	 purge-old-logs true

# binpath controls the value of the PATH environment variable during
# compilation.  If you have unusual tools that need to be in the path to build
# KDE, add them here.  KDE's and Qt's programs are automatically added.
# If you leave this option blank, it will default to the PATH that kdesrc-build had
# when it was started.
#	binpath /bin:/usr/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/X11R6/bin
#	binpath /usr/lib/ccache/bin:/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/X11R6/bin

# This directory is where everything gets built before it is installed.  By
# default it is relative to the value for source-dir.  You can specify an
# absolute path if you'd like (begin the path with a slash).
	build-dir /code/kde/build/KDE

# These are the compilation flags to use by default when compiling KDE.
# gcc supports a -march option in order to generate specific code for pentium4, athlon-xp,
# etc.  See the gcc man page for more information.
#
# NOTE: For KDE 4 these flags are only applied if you set the CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE setting
# to "none" (see the cmake-options setting)
#	cxxflags -pipe -march=native # Don't use native with distributed build

# You can use the set-env option to add values to the build environment.
#	set-env LDFLAGS -Wl,-O1   # Optimize the linker, takes longer.

# If you use software which requires pkg-config, and you need to add entries
# to your pkg-config path, you can also use set-env for that.  Some broken
# systems require you to set this to find e.g. glib.

# qt-copy is a copy of Nokia's Qt, optionally with some bugfixes and

# - If you compile phonon separately, make sure to pass -no-phonon.
# - Alternatively, if you use Qt's phonon, remove "phonon" from the use-modules

# If you use the branch option up in the "global" section to set a
# default KDE version, you should manually choose a branch here for Qt.
# You can see the available branches by looking first on gitorious.org,
# or by using "git branch -r" from the qt-copy source directory.
#
# The "master" branch is the best choice for both kde-qt and official Qt if
# you have no preference.

# Next is shown a "module-set", which is a grouping of modules that has special
# handling of the "repository" option (the module name is automatically added
# to the end for every module defined in this set), and accepts the special
# use-modules option to determine what modules are included in the group.
# Any other options included as defined for every module in the set.
# For every single module passed, kdesrc-build will create the appropriate
# "module" option, with the right repository setting (base + module name).
#
# If you need to set more options for only individual modules, you can add a
# module <name> ... end module as normal after the module-set, but keep in mind
# if you do this that you won't change the order the modules are built in.
#
# Example:
module-set
    # automoc is essential for building KDE's CMake-based modules, and so should be first
    # in this module set (but after Qt, if you're using qt-copy)
    # Phonon is the KDE multimedia layer, which is occasionally synced to Qt.
    use-modules automoc cagibi attica soprano polkit-qt-1 phonon

    # Special handling occurs with this option when used in module-set so you don't
    # have to re-type repository names.
    repository kde-projects

    # Other options are simply passed to each defined module. For example if you
    # uncomment the next line, then the "Debug" build type will be used for every
    # module in this set, which makes modules optimized but still debuggable.

# This set includes the modules required for the "strigi" file analyzer, used to extract
# information contained in various file types for Dolphin previews, Nepomuk tagging, etc.
# Because of the way the strigi git module is setup, CMake *must* be run in order to
# complete the source code update. This is handled by the "reconfigure" option. In addition,
# a special option to CMake is required to get the strigi build system to complete the
# update.
